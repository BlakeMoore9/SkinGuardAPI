## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 📋 Prerequisites
Docker set up on your machine. That's it.

### 🧭 Steps to Get Started

**Option A - Build the Docker Image Locally**:  
Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and execute the following:

```
docker build -t skinguardapi .
```

Then run the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 skinguardapi
```

**Option B - Fetch the Docker Image Directly**:  
Instead of building the image locally, you can pull the image directly from the GitHub Container Registry:


```
docker pull ghcr.io/blakemoore9/skin_lesion_api:1.0.1
```

After pulling, run the Docker container using:


```
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/blakemoore9/skin_lesion_api:1.0.1

```

Both the commands mentioned in **Option A** and **Option B** start a new container. The `-p 8000:8000` option maps the container's port `8000` to your host machine's port `8000`, allowing you to access the application via a web browser. If you're new to Docker, understanding the `-p` option is crucial; without it, you won't be able to access the application externally.
Launch your favorite web browser and head over to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
